## Features

- **Convert Full Width SBS images & videos** to red/cyan anaglyph (classic 3D glasses effect)
- **Keyframing:** Set focus/desaturation/mode for individual frames (videos)
- **Different modes:** Supports Color, Half-color, and Gray anaglyph modes
- **Frame interpolation:** Linear or stepped parameter transitions
- **Hardware acceleration:** Uses OpenCL (via OpenCV UMat) if available
- **Multithreaded video export** with progress dialog and cancel support
- **Intuitive PySide6 GUI** with keyboard shortcuts for speedy workflow
- **Multiple FPS Methods:** Custom FPS, Frames and Duration Based FPS and OpenCV Based FPS
- **No audio in exported videos (yet)**
